### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px" height="29px"> 

I'm a Software Developer focused on designing, maintaining, and evolving backend systems using the .NET ecosystem.

I have experience working with both **legacy applications** (ASP.NET WebForms, .NET Framework) and **modern architectures** (ASP.NET Core, MVC, Web APIs), prioritizing clean code, maintainability, and sustainable evolution.

I enjoy solving real-world problems, improving existing systems, and continuously learning better ways to design and deliver software.

### What I focus on

- Writing maintainable and readable code
- Improving existing systems instead of rewriting everything
- Understanding trade-offs in architectural decisions
- Designing solutions that scale with the business, not just the codebase
